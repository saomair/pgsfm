# AI-Generated Images Directory

This directory contains the OpenAI DALL¬∑E outputs that power the visual system for the PGS FM Ltd website. Every asset is generated with the `gpt-image-1` model using curated prompts that match the site's security- and facilities-management brand identity.

> üìò The same prompt catalogue is codified in `src/lib/dallePrompts.ts` and documented for designers in `branding/dalle-rules.md`.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Prepare credentials** ‚Äì add your API key to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-..." >> .env.local
   ```
2. **Generate images** ‚Äì use the CLI helper or call the `/api/dalle` endpoint (details below).
3. **Post-process** ‚Äì crop or resize the output to the target dimensions, compress, and export as high quality JPEG.
4. **Integrate** ‚Äì place the files in the correct subfolder and confirm the UI renders via `/demo-ai-images`.

Because DALL¬∑E currently produces `1024` and `1792` sized images, you will usually crop the long edge to reach the exact aspect ratios listed above.

## CLI Helper (`npm run generate-dalle`)

Run the generator from the project root:

```bash
npm run generate-dalle -- --category=hero
```

Key flags:

- `--category=<hero|card|team|banner|blog>` ‚Äì generate every prompt in a single category.
- `--file=hero-security-team.jpg` ‚Äì generate one or more specific files (comma-separated).
- `--dry-run` ‚Äì preview the prompts that would be sent without calling OpenAI.

Outputs are written to `public/images/ai-generated/<category>/<fileName>`. Review each image, crop to the target size, and optimise with a lightweight compressor (TinyPNG, Squoosh, or similar).

If `OPENAI_API_KEY` is missing, the script aborts with guidance. The prompts and recommended output sizes come directly from `src/lib/dallePrompts.ts` to keep tooling and documentation aligned.

## API Endpoint (`/api/dalle`)

The Next.js route provides two capabilities:

- `GET /api/dalle` ‚Äì returns the full prompt catalogue.
- `GET /api/dalle?category=hero&fileName=hero-security-team.jpg` ‚Äì returns a single preset.
- `POST /api/dalle` ‚Äì generates an image.

Example request using a preset:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/dalle \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "category": "hero",
    "fileName": "hero-security-team.jpg"
  }'
```

Example request with a custom prompt:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/dalle \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Professional UK security control room, high-vis jackets, modern London skyline outside",
    "size": "1792x1024"
  }'
```

Responses include `imageBase64` (PNG), the `revisedPrompt` supplied by OpenAI, and metadata showing which preset was used. Decode the base64 payload and export a JPEG once you have cropped the asset to the correct dimensions.
